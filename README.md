# Beepbox

A simple library for playing [beepbox](https://www.beepbox.co/) songs. This library is a more polished version of what I made for my [2018 JS13kGames entry](https://github.com/zackurben/js13k-2018)!

This is an open source project under the MIT license, see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for additional information.
